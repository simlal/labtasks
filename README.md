## Steps TODO for live demo
Host the app (for free) with the following steps:
1. Host the github repo on a web hosting service ([PythonAnywhere](https://PythonAnywhere.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com))

2. Setup static files ([AWS S3](www.https://aws.amazon.com/s3/))

3. Migrate the Sqlite3 db to PostgresSQL ([Railway](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Render](https://render.com/docs/databases))


## About the app
The goal was to introduce myself and get familiar with the Django framework. Basically the app is just a chatroom-style app : register/login to an account, create or join a lab, create/edit labspaces (chatrooms), post/edit/delete messages.

I also wanted to play around with CSS and implement a bit of JavaScript for some of the functionalities and user interactions.
